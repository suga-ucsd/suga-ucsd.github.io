                        <div class="blog-content">
                          <p>Why Blog is an important question. I see people write blogs with a definite type of work. As for me I am interested in several things to write about a single topic/direction. Firstly the fact that some people can go on for paragraphs after paragraphs on a single topic without jotting down the points that summarise the main idea. I cant do that,so in a way this will help me develop that skill. Which is kinda important in life. Also this place will act as a idea folde/inspiration folder that is basically all kinds of inspiration/idewas I have. I know making my ideas public is a bad idea, so I will only write the stuff that I am okay with making public.</p>
                          <p>
                            One of the very important reasons for starting this blog is to prove to myself that I  can fisnish something pretty regulary.School forces me to do that but I am not gonna be in school all my life. This has got to do with the severety of procrastnation that hits me sometimes. To combat I wish to finish at least one thing everyday taht will increase some amount of dopamine in me. Thats why I would like to finish at least one dog each day. Even during writing this I have to take breaks every two sentence to regenerate my dopamine. This makes it extremely difficult for me to finish any project I start. Thats pretty much all about my difficulty doing task and the reason I started this blog. I thought multiple times to use claude for my blog, but then whats the point really, my "thoughts" will just be the amalagamation of a million sof blogs all over the universe(or wherever they get their data from ). I dont want that.
