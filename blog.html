                            <p>Solarpunk is what cyberpunk wishes to beand fails miserably to achieve it. It is supposed to be utopia that cant adhere to practicality. But these assumptions stem because of the preconcieved notion that people face in modern times. The current climate of everything influences this judgement. Due to absolutely no hope in this world, people think we cant achieve this, some people say the "current political climate wont let it be achieved". The current political climate is made by people who care about their profits hence I give them the benefit of the doubt. I think it can be achieved. I am not here to judge whether the current climate will let it happen, whether capitalism will be doom for our civilization, I dont wanna discuss the politics governing the plausibilty, but rather the science and math that govern the possibilty.</p>
                            <p>I watched a few too many ghibli movies hence this optimism. This optimism will be the death of me. Very oxymoronic, but the worl wouldnt exist without irony. The current technology age is very overengineered and wasteful, is what you would hear from a non engineering, because that what it looks like from the outside. Optimization is an imporatnt aspect of engineering design and is in fact taken very seriously. Just like how it is proved that a rubiks cube of ANY configuration can be solved in less than 20 moves, I feel any engineering design can be optimized to the utmost optimality. Suboptimality is preffered because of feasiibility, I would like to prove, engineering design is possible with one constraint removed and a better suboptimality can be achieved. The constraint being the fuel, the energy, the main constraint that shapes the objective function the most. I feel the above statement is feasible, possible and rather necassary especially to fuel the hope for humanity.</p>
                            <p>So heres the plan for the next few eons whenever I get the time, because I am quite busy with multiple objectives, I will research and draw conclusion on everything that can make the current engineering environment to a much more solarpunky one. I think there must be many such patents/research papers that take energy consumption and the type of energy consumptio to be the primary concern and make their design accordingly. I predict they use solar, wind et. I want to strenthen my prediction or may be even come to a different conclusion altogether. This realm is completely out of reach for me just yet, but the optimistic future I dream of is pulling me towards it. The pull is faint and foggy, I want to strengthen it. I also want to see it before(?) I die. I will document every finding so do not worry ;)</p>

                            <p>This one will be very quick also probably the only pop culture related post, but I have to write it because I have been binging this show and just cant seem get it oput of my head. Its like one of those few shows that are just instant classics.</p>

                          <p>Why Blog is an important question. I see people write blogs with a definite type of work. As for me I am interested in several things to write about a single topic/direction. Firstly the fact that some people can go on for paragraphs after paragraphs on a single topic without jotting down the points that summarise the main idea. I cant do that,so in a way this will help me develop that skill. Which is kinda important in life. Also this place will act as a idea folde/inspiration folder that is basically all kinds of inspiration/idewas I have. I know making my ideas public is a bad idea, so I will only write the stuff that I am okay with making public.</p>
                          <p>
                            One of the very important reasons for starting this blog is to prove to myself that I  can fisnish something pretty regulary.School forces me to do that but I am not gonna be in school all my life. This has got to do with the severety of procrastnation that hits me sometimes. To combat I wish to finish at least one thing everyday taht will increase some amount of dopamine in me. Thats why I would like to finish at least one dog each day. Even during writing this I have to take breaks every two sentence to regenerate my dopamine. This makes it extremely difficult for me to finish any project I start. Thats pretty much all about my difficulty doing task and the reason I started this blog. I thought multiple times to use claude for my blog, but then whats the point really, my "thoughts" will just be the amalagamation of a million sof blogs all over the universe(or wherever they get their data from ). I dont want that.
