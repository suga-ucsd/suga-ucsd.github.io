                               <p>Okay I started with Vim and I thought Neovim was bloated. But thats false and I will prove why. Of course I started out as a VSCode pleb. Ugh I was such a naive little summer child. Now I cant imagine my life without vim. But I think I am getting ahead of myself. This is a very coding centric introduction to neovim. But lately I have been using it for LaTeX, and I also heard that people are using it for writing books which they say was there intended purpose but I disagree. I started off coding using an IDE as everyone does and as everyone should, its easier. Then I shifted to VSCode and started building build systems myself instead of the packaged compiler/interpreter with the IDE. Some reasons why I used to use VSCode is the extensions and how much you can customize it. I used to think it was a lot. I mean it is a lot. But if the reader knows by about Vim/Neovim architecture even a bit, they would know customization is quite a big culture in that environment.</p>

                             I was always attracted to these cyberpunk high contrast themes so I started putting these themes in VSCode. This was when I used windows (yes blasphemy). I mean this was my initial days of learning about systems, OSs, customization, minimalism etc. Then I slowly transferred to dual booting ubuntu. Definitely for coding purposes. And slowly and steadily I started spending more time on Ubuntu than windows. Then other than playing video games, windows served no purpose. Then when the new proton release came, every steam game could be run on linux with pretty okay performance. I deleted windows and made ubuntu my main OS. This is the moment when I started cutomizing things. I was using VSCode for a while and I suddenly got introduced to vim. I think I was scrolling some programmer subreddit. I thought of giving vim a try. Absolutely despised it. So instead of using the vim text editor as the main editor. I used the vim extension on VSCode. I tried using it but in the end I was always on insert mode. Then what was the point really.

                              So what I did was one fine day, I started using the Vim mode more and more in normal mode in VSCode. And just drastically shifted to Vim the text editor. But I think switching to the text editor was a bit too big of a step. So I got discouraged and just ended up using VSCode for a bit. After a while I heard of this text editor called Emacs. Started using it especialy doom emacs. Fell in love with it and used the Vim mode in it. I used emacs with evil mode(vim mode) for quite a long time. But then I felt emacs was very bloated. This was the time when I was experimenting with desktop environments, window managers etc, to get the most minimal set up possible. I landed on i3wm from gnome. A big jump and may be I might post a blog about it and how I configured mine catered to my requirements. And now that I shifted to i3, using emacs just felt wrong. In between somewhere I started customizing vim, but the plugin support learning curve felt steep so I got discouraged. But now I thought lets just install neovim, especially because it had lua support which was supposedly easy to learn and more flexible. And thats exactly what I did.

                              I had tried getting into neovim with lua config a lot before. But I could never get into it. The main reason was I would watch youtube videos and follow their config. But the config should reflect you. It should reflect what you want. So I started the init lua config from scratch. With a blank init lua I started with a package manager. Then just learned lua and then slowly and steadily added stuff that I would like for myself. Since I am a minimalist pleb myself. I just needed a package manager, an lsp, an lsp manager, autocompletions, snippet support, thats pretty much it. And some others that just makes the usage of neovim much easier. The freedom I feel with neovim is just amazing. I am very fast with neovim, I am very proficient now but theres so much more to learn.
