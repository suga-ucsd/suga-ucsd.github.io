                            This topic has been long time coming. I mean I work in this topic, and have been working on this topic for a while now. Yes I know its extremely bad for the environement. But I find it really cool. But there are a lot of caveats in this. First of all Generative AI should not be used for art, which we will get to that later. Overuse of gen AI leads to becoming dumb. Gen AI agents are not real people, dont get attached to them. Lonliness can lead people to weird places. Gen AI has a rapid boom over the last few months and I am pretty sure its not gonna stop anytime soon. I worked on GAN for my undergrad project. Back then diffusion and GANs were the state of the art, but in a year, we are using diffusion using transformers and everything. We now have LLMs, Visual models, VLMs and its only the start. I have talked about LLMs before and I would like to stick to that opinion, I feel it can be used for something more but currently its not being used effectively.

                            Now what is gen AI. Firstly use of the phrase AI is absolutely wrong. Because I have mentioned in a blog from before that we still havent tapped into intelligence. For the sake of arguement and cohenrent thoughts lets use AI as a layman would. Gen AI basically refers to the extrapolation of data consistent with its input. Input and output can be of the same domain or of different domain. In the end everything is a transformer. Sometimes when people have this notion that these LLMs cna turn evil and whatever I scoff as its really just matrices interacting with each other. Its not demonic. I really like the idea of a function extrapolating its input to output something that is in coherence with the input and much more. It has two aspects, to be coherent, to have the correct information.
