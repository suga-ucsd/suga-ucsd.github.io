                              Data is a currency right now. Any form of data that has ever been associated with you, is being used or rather will be used as an attribute for...TARGETED ADS TOWARDS YOU!!! Okay that was anti climactic I know, target ads is the least of concerns, yes they are annoying but there are things worse than targeted ads. Imagine everything about you, what you like, what you dislike, what is your aspirations, what you are good at, what you are bad at, etc. is written in front of you on a list associated with your full government name. The worst part being its somewhere on a server on the internet, not one server several servers. And ANYONE in this world can access it. This is worse than my worst nightmares.

                             Everyone in this world is on the internet now. Everyone in this world uses social media. EVERYONE IS ONLINE. Hence EVERYONES data is on the internet. Current generation is quite online, they are on social media majority of the day. The algorithm governs what we consume and overtime the algorithm starts suggesting media that propagate a certain idea the company has decided to propagate. And thats why given the social media content that is supposedly "catered" towards you is the same for everyone and not just you. Everyone becomes the same person who like the same things. This is a recommendation singularity that is being reached by almost every social media and by every person that interacts with it.

                              There is only one solution to this. Every possible service should be hosted locally and every data associated with you should be downloaded and kept with you. Every photo, every document etc should be stored in a hard disk and then should be hosted locally. Google drive should become obsolete. Every possible data should not be given to companies because they dont store your data they harvest it from you to profit off of it. AI models should be run on local servers hosted at your own house. I agree using a local model will have bad results, but only initially. Over time if you train it with your data, locally, it should give much better results in the long run. This I have mentioned in a previous blog. I will be making blogs on homelabs and ways to make it in the future. This blog was just an introduction for this series of blogs.
