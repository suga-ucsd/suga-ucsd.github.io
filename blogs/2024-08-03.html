                            <p>Okay the word "difficulty" is maybe inaccurate, its not difficult per say. More like comparatively more involved than it should be. Functional programming in itself is a big concept, the build system of haskell is one of the most painful things to setup especially using cabal. I still haven't been able to do it for a personal project, I have only been using ghc and nothing else. But this blog is not only about my ongoing war with haskell or the impertinance of functional programming and how a bird brain troglodyte like me can even come close to get any form hint of it, its mostly about category theory and how its so useless irl that its probably the most important topics I have come accross in my 22 years of existence. That does not mean I understood not does not it mean it can be easily understood. Although it does mean I will eventually understand it and go around town just shouting at top of my lungs how Monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors and severely condemn anyone who asks how by saying how they do not know it cause its so easy to understand. This blog is basically my first impressions on all three of them. If anyone ever reads this and wants to come to a judgement that I am wrong and dumb, well I am.</p>
                            <p>
                                At the time of writing this blog I do not have any idea on what a Monad is, this series of blogs will be about my quest of acquire this forbidden knowledge on the above three topics mentioned. We know these three are severely related, two of them being governed by the other one. Category theory is the mathematics for mathematics. Like a birds eye view of all of math. The name "category theory" suggests the study of categories, which is only kind of true because the impression I got after reading a bit of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introductory category theory</a> and watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0Ek86IH-3Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> video, but its more about the relation between categories, relation between the relation between the categories, categories of relation between the relation between the categories and so on. The relations are the most important aspect of this field of math. I studied about categories, natural transformation and only glimpsed functors. I wish get a more in depth knowledge to a point where I can do accurate enough analysis.

                                Functional programming is the paradigm every programmer ends up in after a significant amount of programming in your life but also have an intense drive to learn. Functional programming comes hand in hand with a strong type system. People were praising typescript for it, but that was only the vocal majority that has only done JS all their life. Type was a big thing when haskell was invented which I will be touching on later. I feel like without a strong type system the functional programming paradigm does not obey its definition. Type system to FP is like a human without a soul. Functional programming allows a very strict modularizing code that has been aligning with my coding phisolophy lately. Other than zinging one liners for which non functional code needs a much verbose context, functional programming provides a strict and dare I say pure way of thinking. You weirdly think in a backward fashion which is very hard to describe in the limited dictionary of the english alphabet. But I would highly suggest for anyone reading this, to try out FP, try programming in Lisp for a bit, I think getting the vibe is much faster in Lisp, but it does not have a strongly typed system. To describe it more accurately think of boxes of resources that uses pipes to transfer from one box to other. The boxes are self sufficient worlds with all the resources needed already inside, hence any code execution would not change the behaviour of any element outside of these boxes. The type system in the same analogy would be the type of these elements inside of the boxes, they are defined accurately in the outside world and are used strictly as them inside the boxes.

                                Now why haskell, no reason other than a strong desire to feel a sense of superiority after I learn to use it. On a serious note, Haskell was one the first functional programming languages with a strong type system. The semantics are difficult to understand but makes sense once you get the hang of it, which I havent yet. I dont have much to say about the language. I probably would have more in a future CTFPDH. Anyway this field was extremely wild and pretty new for me and I would like to discover it more and include more technically stuff.
