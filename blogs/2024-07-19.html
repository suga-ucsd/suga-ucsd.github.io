                            <p>This one will be very quick also probably the only pop culture related post, but I have to write it because I have been binging this show and just cant seem get it oput of my head. Its like one of those few shows that are just instant classics. Okay I have to be fully honest, it took around 6 months to resume this blog again, but it gives me all the more extra clarity. Regular shows tagline is "anything but" which is actually quite amazing to think about. You wouldnt know about the tagline unless you have read about regular show, it doesnt show in the actual show. Its about anthropomorphic birds, racoons, bubblegum machine, orcs, a fukcing yeti, etc. living in a normal yet an abnormal world. We follow Mordecai and Rigby and their adventures in the world they live. Okay adventures is a big word, makes it seem like they want to go on these adventures. They really just work in park whose manager is Benson. They dont want to work and they slack off, so whatever Benson gives them to do, they start doing it but end up in some absolute insane problem that leads to space-time destruction level threats. Its an absurdist show but more about this thought later. </p>
                            <p>The idea of things happening seemingly out of nowhere is fascinating to me. The duo dont wanna be in the situations they are always in. Every situation starts with them wanting to do something extremely trivial like cleaning the park or moving a bench or putting some chairs. But somehow they turn into either them being in a earth shattering situation, my personal favourite being a party horse coming to earth out of nowhere and then it has to take a US history test else the whole earth will be destroyed. Yes every episode is a kids weird fever dream, but thats only a small aspect of why I love this show. Every character has an overarching storyline, every situation has a conclusion and every character progresses. The show is like spy kids 2 and the overall storyline is like that one line by steve buschemi. The show is quite mature. Its aimed towards kids but somehow is quite adult. Its exactly like Gumball but from a different era, ngl Gumball has perfectly carried regular shows legacy. It tackles relationships like no other show I have ever seen.</p>
                            <p>This show is filled with absurdist humour. It  doesnt make sense majority of times but thats what funny about it. It resonates life to such an extent that its sometimes uncanny. Absurdity is life, life is absurdity. Anything can happen at any time anywhere. Its on us how we want to percieve it, its on us how we respond/react and still end up completing what we initially intended to complete. The duo completes what they were intended because they have an intensive to do so. Benson would fire them. That makes them do everything they are told. They have something they want in life. To not get fired. There is no meaning to life. You need to make your own meaning. You need to do what it takes to get to the meaning you defined. Doesnt matter whatever life throws at you, you have something that you wanna achieve, you are gonna achieve it. Thats it. Thats the blog. About Regular show. Because it doesnt matter. But I like it. May be regular show was the friends we made along the way.</p>
