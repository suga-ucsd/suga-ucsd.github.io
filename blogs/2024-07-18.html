                          <p>Why Blog is an important question. I see people write blogs with a definite type of work. As for me I am interested in several things to write about a single topic/direction. Firstly the fact that some people can go on for paragraphs after paragraphs on a single topic without jotting down the points that summarise the main idea. I cant do that,so in a way this will help me develop that skill. Which is kinda important in life. Also this place will act as a idea folder/inspiration folder that is basically all kinds of inspiration/idewas I have. I know making my ideas public is a bad idea, so I will only write the stuff that I am okay with making public.</p>

                            One of the very important reasons for starting this blog is to prove to myself that I  can fisnish something pretty regulary.School forces me to do that but I am not gonna be in school all my life. This has got to do with the severety of procrastnation that hits me sometimes. To combat I wish to finish at least one thing everyday that will increase some amount of dopamine in me. Thats why I would like to finish at least one dog each day. Even during writing this I have to take breaks every two sentence to regenerate my dopamine. This makes it extremely difficult for me to finish any project I start. Thats pretty much all about my difficulty doing task and the reason I started this blog. I thought multiple times to use claude for my blog, but then whats the point really, my "thoughts" will just be the amalagamation of a million sof blogs all over the universe(or wherever they get their data from ). I dont want that.

                            I should point out the topics that I will be writing about are stuff that I have thought about to projects on for an extended period of time. This blog will also serve as a catalogue for my knowledge conquests. Logging everything is a very good Idea to keep tabs on everything I do. I have too many interest, so much so that I forget about most of the ideas I have. These blogs are to have those catalogued, so in the future if I ever wanna forget my cringey past self, I wouldnt cuz everything will be documented. Any form of creation is good creation. Better than consumption. My environment is very consumer based making me extremely surrendering and not rebelling. This is my way to get a form of rebel to myself so that I get ahold of my life once again. This form of creation is closer to curation. Curation of sparse ideas accross all the domain of knowledge.

                              I would like to admit, I have written this blogpost in a long timeline of three weeks. It took quite a while to actualy come to my senses and get an idea of the type of content I want to propagate through my blog. Majority of that time was to manually go on witch hunts to hunt for the why from everywhere and however big my inner domain is. Personally I dont think my inner domain is not that big but rather is convulated. I fight with my mind every waking hour(sometimes even in my sleep) of my life, getting the ideas out is difficult and hence this blog formed a feedback loop. I intend to play with this feedback loop to unwind my mind and make everything easier for me. This blog is based mostly on selfish reasons, to just somehow get myself get working in this society. I need to be able to function. Its important for me.
