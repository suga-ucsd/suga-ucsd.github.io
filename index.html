          Hello fellow traveler, I am an AI researcher that is trying to make more intuitive and safe for the environment. I have degrees from IIT Ropar, Bachelors '23 and UCSD, Masters '25. I have multiple AI pipelines for various use cases. You can read more about them <a href="projects.html">here</a>.

            <ul>
              <li>Making AI cheaper and sustainable 
                <p>Current ecosystem of Machine learning demands the usage of a lot of resources for training and inference. I have this intense desire to train models using very little resources. This will lead to cheaper prices. I think AI is an amazing technology that has extreme potential. But right now its usage is breaking the environment. I want to find out ways to make it less environment wrecking and more optimal to use. The temperature of the world has increased a lot just because of AI usage. Sustainable AI is extremely important especially if we really even want to use AI, we need to be alive for it.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Decreasing inference times
                <p>Inference is important to test AI models out, benchmark them and then eventually use them. For each of these use cases the faster we can get the model to the run the faster we can ineract with it and the more edge cases we can test out. This will eventually lead to faster model evaluation. This is a more mainstream reasoning for faster inference time. The reason I want to work on faster inference time is because I want instant response from the robotic digital assistant that I would be making. I have wrote all about it <a href="blogs/2024-07-23.html">here</a>. But the main idea is keeping the fully trained model inside a hard disk and the inference time is near zero. Its like keeping an offline internet with you. I also have adhd and I want everything to be fast af.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Controllable learning based models
                <p>
                Learning based models are quite incoherent. They are unintuitive, unimaginable, not complex yet unexplainable. I would like to remove all the "un" from the words. We know the structure we know the process yet to control the output we generally tend to use hacks. I believe we can fundamentally control the structure and hence the output. The direction that I am most interested in is using logical statements as a definitive structure to guide any learning based system to the exact output. I am currently finishing up a paper with Prof. Sonia Martinez on this topic with application in robotics.
