            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am currently a master's student at UCSD advised by prof. Nikolay Atanasov. My main area of expertise/research is reinforcement learning, non-linear control, game theory. I like the math and theory that makes these subjects what they are. I am very interested in building really big robots to fight the kaijus that will attempt to reign our earth in the year 2124. I mostly live in the clouds but I try to have my foot in the ground.</p>
            <p>I love to play games and this love has guided me to make quite a few unfinished game engines and physics simulations. I want to make my own chip and computer someday with my own flavour of assembly language. I want to make everything from scratch. People say not to reinvent the wheel, but I disagree, I want to reinvent the wheel so that I can reinvent the airplane, so that I can reinvent the terraforming space ship that gave life to mars in the year 2525.</p>
            <p>My future area of research is to make machine and humans one. Robots/machines and humanity should not be against each other but rather should be extension of each other. I want to make this happen in my lifetime. Also controlling big robots will be more fun this way.</p>
            <p>I do not want to call myself an artist but I do dabble my fingers in art. I frequently combine engineering and art as there is no line between as most professionals would not say. I do not think art and science are separate. They are the leafs from the same STEM ( ba dum tshhh... ). I would add some of my artwork here as and when I get over my fear of getting judged.</p>
